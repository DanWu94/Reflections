What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I create a hidden folder named .git. I do this because I need to use git for version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I think it's like a buffer where you can add anything you want to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I don't know...
