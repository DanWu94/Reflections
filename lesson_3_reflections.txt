When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working with a group of people on a big project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In case that I mess up locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork will clone a repository on the GitHub while clone is to clone a repository from GitHub to your local. Branches are developed within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I don't know...

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I upload my work on a repository on the cloud and when I do that I send a message to other members of the group. It gets harder to collaborate without Git or GitHub.
